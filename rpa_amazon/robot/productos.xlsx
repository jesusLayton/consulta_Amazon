The `productos.xlsx` file is an Excel file and cannot be represented in plain text. However, I can provide you with a description of how the data might be structured within the Excel file. 

You can create the `productos.xlsx` file with the following columns:

- Product Name
- Price
- Description
- URL
- Rating

You can populate it with sample data like this:

| Product Name | Price | Description       | URL                     | Rating |
|--------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Product 1    | $10   | Description 1     | http://example.com/1    | 4.5    |
| Product 2    | $20   | Description 2     | http://example.com/2    | 4.0    |
| Product 3    | $30   | Description 3     | http://example.com/3    | 4.8    |

To create the `productos.xlsx` file, you can use Excel or any other spreadsheet software to set up the columns and add sample data as shown above.
